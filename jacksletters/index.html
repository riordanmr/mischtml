    <h1>Letters from Jack Riordan 1945-1946</h1>
    <div class="original">
        <p>This is a collection of letters written by John Alvin Riordan (1927 - 2011) 
            to his family in Detroit, while he was serving in the Navy. 
            They were saved by his mother and later turned over to John and his wife Mary. 
            When Mary passed away in 2015, their son Bill came into possession of these handwritten letters. 
        </p>
        <p>John - better known as Jack - joined the Navy right out of high school 
          in 1945, while World War II was still raging.
          But by the time he was done with basic training, the war was over, so Jack
          was sent to Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey for officer's training.
          Eventually he was sent to San Francisco and after some shakedown cruises, 
          sailed on the troop tranport ship 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Renville_(APA-227)">USS Renville</a>, 
          ferrying returning soldiers between Pearl Harbor and San Francisco.
        </p>
        <p>As with many other sailors in the year following the war, Jack left the
            Navy in 1946.
        </p>
        <p>All letters were addressed to:</p>
        <p class="links">Mr &amp; Mrs A. J. Riordan</p>
        <p class="links">16540 Cruise</p>
        <p class="links">Detroit 27, Mich</p>
        <p>Here's the list of surviving letters.  Each contains the transcribed text of the letter,
            plus the images of the original letter. 
            Text surrounded in [brackets] is interpretations, corrections, or commentary from me.
