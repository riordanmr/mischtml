Letters from Jack 1945-1946
These letters were written by John Alvin Riordan (1927 - 2011) to his family in Detroit, while he was serving in the Navy. They were saved by his mother and turned over to Jack and his wife Mary. When Mary passed away in 2015, their son Bill came into possession of these handwritten letters. 
Jack spent some time in San Francisco and after some shakedown cruises, went on the USS Renville to Pearl Harbor. He ferried returning troops from Pearl Harbor to San Francisco. 
Jack's time in the Navy was allegedly cut short by a clerical error, which caused him to be discharged honorably in 1946 after serving only one year.

Random notes from conversation with Bill: Mazda bought the Flatrock casting plant and Dad was assigned to them to turn over the plant. Dad had some people from Mazda over to the house, because they had nothing to do over Christmas. Bill was there. Dad always brought a briefcase into work. Once he hauled it out at the end of the day, it was a sign that the Mazda people could talk to him about personal stuff. Like the difference between chickenshit and bullshit.

Dear Folks,
There['s] so much I want to tell you about this place[.] I don't think I have time but I'll see what I can do.
We arrived at the school at 3pm yesterday. We had a short physical[,] registered at the school[,] got our classes assigned, our barracks assigned[,] made our beds[,] and then we went to chow. By the way we had a fine steak dinner. After dinner we went back to our rooms for [a] while then we went to a show. I [saw] "State Fair"[.] Boy that was a good picture[;] you should see it.
What amazes me about this place is the lack of officers. Nobody tells you what to do. So far we can [do] anything we want to.
I've a pretty tough program in school but I've got a lot of free time. So far I've got 3 afternoons off plus Sundays off[.] But don't expect to[o] many letters[.] I think the homework will really start being poured over.
The school is on River street which is just like Jefferson in that it goes right along the water front[.] 3 liberty boats, big frieghters [sic] are docked right under our back window. You also get a fine view of the New York skyline.
There are 8 guys in my room which just makes it comfortable. Our barracks is a little old but what could I expect in the Navy[.] at least the bed is pretty soft.
Well I'd better close now. I think something is coming off. I'll write more later.
Your Salty Son
Jack

Dear Folks,
I'm on my first leave now and still I haven't got my complete uniform. I'm running around in my civies. A couple of the boys and I went over to New York last nite and boy what a town. It makes Detroit look like a hick town. Everybody and thier [sic] brother was on Broadway last night. Enclosed you will find a picture taken in a penny arcade on Broadway. Was that the place [-] it had twice as many machines as Edgewater. We had a swell time trying to find Times Square[;] we just kept asking people and riding subways. I'll bet we rode 10 subways last nite. I think I might dash up to Newark Tuesday or Thursday. I can take the Subway up there in about a half an hour.
So much for the good times[.] Now I'll tell you about the work I have to [do]. It isn't much but it's going to keep me busy when things get rolling. So far we had two days of classes that is Friday & Saturday. All my classes are in the moring [sic] except for a few which gives me most afternoons to myself and I like that very much. I intend to play basketball unless my studies get to[o] tough which I think is going to happen because this is suppose[d] [to be a] really tough school. I think I'll go out and see what's doing.
Your Son,
Jack
P. S. See the movie "Duffy's Tavern" when it comes around[.] It's good.

Dear Folks,
I just finished reading your nice letter, But I must say I was greatly disappointed to hear how C. C. did against Boystown.
You wanted to know a few things so hear [sic] goes, the boys are fine. 3 of them are from Detroit, one from Grosse Pointe, 1 Almant [?] Mich[,] 1 from Cincinatti[,] and 1 from Jersey. You can see there are enough guys from Detroit to keep me busy shooting the bull. One of the kids by the name of Powers use to live on Tracy near Florence and he knows a lot of kids I do.
No I wasn't thrilled going through Canada. I was bored I couldn't see a thing. We were traveling at night you know[.]
Things are starting to get straightened around here and I['m] still having a fine time. We can go to Hoboken every day from 4 to 6 and we get an over nite every week-end and Tuesday and Thursday nite off. Not so bad eh.
Don't go having any of those dreams because I don't think I'll be out for a long time and at this rate I won't mind it a bit. I have 22 hours of classes a week and the rest of the time to myself[.] (That's better than working at Fords). I'm doing a lot of things I won't do if I was a civilian[.] New York is really a town to see but it really costs a lot of dough[.]
Now for the weather, so far it's been fine. Today you can run around in your undershrit [sic]. It's foggy most of the day but it clears up about 2pm and at nite your get a fine view of New York[.] 
One of the biggest ocean liners in the world[,] the "Europa"[,] just passed by. Man was that big. It is really interesting here. You should see those tugs swarm around that ship.
Dad, I think I'll go up to Newark and see Mr Kelly Saturday[.] It will only take me about 20 min. I can catch a subway there.
Will somebody do me a favor. Will some of the tribe go over to McLaughlin's and find out "Mac" address.
Another note to Dad. 
One of my classes is Public Speaking and Navy Correspondence[.] It ought to help me a lot.
I'd better close now, I'm on my way to New York.
Your Son
Jack
PS. To Mary Jane
You better not save that ice cream. I won't be home to eat it till Christmas and I don't think it will last that long.

Dear Folks,
I'm back safe and sound from Washington. Joe and I had a swell time. I got into Washington at 4:30 and I met Joe and two of his boyfriends [?]. His two friends were old salts and they had a lot of dough so we spent thier [sic] money. We stayed at the Hotel Continental, one of the best hotels in Washington. It is right across from the Union Station which is "ump"teen times bigger than M. C. Depot.
Saturday nite we went to Jefferson's memorial & Washington's Memorial. Sunday Joe and I went to St Patrick's Church. I guess it's the biggest church in Washington. There I saw Justice Frank Murphy[.] Boy was that the good sermon[.] That Priest was the best speaker I've ever heard. 
If you ever take a vacation you should go down to Washington[;] it really is a beautiful town. I didn't see one factory or any thing like that[.] It has nice parks all over.
Sunday afternoon we went through the Capitol. It was very interesting.
Things must be pretty dull since I left, your letters are very newsy (joke) and what is this corruption you keep slinging that you answer every letter I write[.] I got about 2 or 3 letters from you last week and I wrote about 5. What do you think about that.
Well I [pretty??] starting closing now. Say how can I get Mac's address out of you.
I got a letter from Bob Dillon today and he says he's breaking off with Pat R. Good Deal eh.
By the way why do you like me better when I'm penniless?
Thanks for sending "Boats" letter
Your (not quiet [sic] penniless) Son
Jack

Dear Folks,
Right now I'm on watch and tonite is a liberty nite. Can you beat that? You can see what kind of paper I'm using [a page apparently ripped from a spiral bound notebook.] I got it out of the watch book. We have to make rounds and sign in every so often. The watch is only two hrs long so it isn't too bad.
Tommorrow [sic] Dick Marley [?] and I are going out for a turkey dinner place[.] I don't know [illegible] but the USO is lining something up for us. I hope it turns out good anyway. It would be fun eating someplace for a change. Not that the food isn't good here[;] it is just that it doesn't appeal to your taste all the time. We will have a full day tomorrow because we don't have to be in till 8am Friday. That is the longest leave I've had yet. 
Good thing I got that money from home last week. I had to use $5.22 to buy athletic equipment today. Is that the fouled up deal. Making us pay for our own stuff. I thought the navy was suppose to pay for all you need. Now I know what a "floating five" is. Talking about money payday looks like it's a mile off. So far they haven't asked us to sign up for bonds or insurance. Talking about insurance, we had a big talk about that the other day in class. Our math teacher told us not to take it out. I don't think the Navy will like that so well. I think they might put some pressure on us and make us take it out. But I'm going to see if I can get out of it.
I must remind you that I did not recieve [sic] a letter today. It seems like I spend half my life writing and what happens no mail. Tell Eileen I'll write a nice letter as soon as possible. But I think I send an [sic] enough letters to that certain Cruse address to keep the mailman busy.
Speaking of letters, I saw one of the best pictures the other night it was "Love Letters" and it was really good. I've seen more good pictures here than I'd see at home in a year, and it only costs a dime while it costs $1.50 in N.Y. Here's a line up of the pictures we've seen[:]
**** State Fair - Very, very good
** George White's Scandals - Good
*** Dolly Sisters - Very Good
**** Love letters - Very Very Good
How do you like my system of grading them. But really "State Fair" is a very good musical and "Love Letters" is serious but good.
By the way have Jim find out Geo Hissongs address for me will you. Make sure to do this one. I still haven't got Mac's address. Fine way to keep up my morale.
Say, what's the word on those pictures you took of the boys. I guess I have to keep plugging or I never get them.

(Note to Mother)
* In your last letter you were complianing [sic] about me not answering all your questions[.] Well how about you. I only ask a few simple questions and you don't even mention them in your letter. (Boy, I'm really laying it on thick in this letter.)
* Note to Dad
I['m] going to try to get to Newark one of these fine days but I kind of image [sic] they would only work half a day on Saturday so that leaves me hanging. But I'll try it any way.
Note to Jim
How about rushing the news of the Demby [??] CCH [CCH is presumably Catholic Central High] game right to me. There are things at stake on that game.
Note to Rich
Don't worry Rich you'll get your white hat pretty soon but I image [sic] that it will be a little big for you.
Note to Eileen
That postcard collection of yours ought to be growing now. I think I've sent some pretty good ones home. I'll send some more if I ever go any place interesting to you.
Note to Mary Jane
Do you still remember what I look like. You know it's been a long time since I've been home. Some one of these days I'll have a leave to come [?] on. Februarry [sic] for sure.
It really does seem like longer than 3 weeks. Not because I [sic] home sick or anything like that. It is just that I [sic] done so much in that time. I've really seen some sights in the pass [sic] 3 weeks. I've run out of ink so I'd better close now.

Dear Folks,
This is going to be some letter if I tell you all I did over Thanksgiving. Boy I don't think I ever had such a good time in all my life, and on so little money (It it [sic] to be a little I only had a buck).
I will tell the story in chronological order. Dick Manley [?] (a St Alphonse's Boy) and I got up at 10 AM (we missed moring [sic] chow) we left about 1030 for New York. We arrived at 99 Park Ave. That's a U. S. O. where they give out tickets to about anything in New York. We got in line, there and waited till noon when they start giving out tickets[.] The first tickets we procured were meal tickets to eat at the Hotel Belvedere. It is a real classy place right across the street from Madison Sq Garden (more about the Garden later). We walked in the Hotel and the Head Waiter came up to us and asked us if we were from the U. S. O. We answered Yes so he showed us to a nice table for two. Dick and I then had a very good turkey and all the trimings [sic] and when I say all the trimings I mean what I say. We had turkey[,] sweet potatoes, squash, cider, soup[,] coffee, pie and I don't know what else. How do you like that, a $3.50 dinner for free. 
After that we went to Radio City Music Hall (cost = $1.70) compliment of U. S. O. and saw “Week-end at the Waldorf” and those famous Rockettes. You've heard of these precision dancers. They are pretty good but the best part of the show was the theater it's self [sic]. It was really big. It has a dozen elevators to get you up to the four balconys [sic]. It seats about 5,500 and thats [sic] pretty big.
Sounds like a big day but we are just starting. What a frantic day.
We got out of the show about 5 o'clock. So we went to the canteen and had coffee and doughnuts (always eating). We went back to 99 Park Ave and got tickets to Madison Sq. Garden where the “Ice Follies” was playing.
We had 2 hrs to fool away so we went to the Jewish Welfare Board and had another turkey dinner[.] Boy did I feel out of place there [-] 2 Irishmen and 1000 Jews but they treated us fine.
We went to the Garden and thoroughly enjoyed the revue.
After the show we meet [sic] a couple of girls and was the one I had good looking my my. I think she's the best looking girl in N. Y. C. But don't worry I'm all right I won't get in trouble.
After we took the girls home we went to a party at the Hotel Astor. There was a big party there. It was the 2nd or 3rd anniversary of “Spors” [??]. It was the Biggest brawl I was ever at.
Everything was free including the beer which was very plentiful[.] The party was over at 1 AM so we headed back. 
Man was that the day. If I had paid for everything it would of cost me $25 but as it was it only cost me .85.  
Dick Miller says he had a fine talk with Dad yesterday. I'm gald [sic] to hear you still remember me. I throught [sic] you forgot about me[;] I havent got a [illegible due to crease in letter] in 3 days and I've written at least 4 letters. That doesn't add up in my language.
Lights out soon so good bye

Dear Folks,
Another uneventful day in some ways but I did make some progess [sic] in the right way. I went to the first meeting of the Newman Club. It was held in the K of C hall about 2 blocks away. It is a fairly nice place even though it is old. The Chaplain was there. He gave a little speech and then we played pool. I think I'm going to enjoy the club. By the way do you know what the Newman Club is. If you don't know tell me and I'll explain it later. Right now I've only about 1 ½ min to finish this letter so I'll have to make hay here.
What a state this is. First it rained for 2 days and it has snowed for 2 days. Is it a mess walking up to chow. It is windy as hades and that doesn't help much.
We had a pep meeting today because we're having a basketball game here tommorrow [sic]. 
Dec 2
Well I started this letter 3 days ago and I think I've been doing pretty good [-] a whole page in 3 days[.] I'll see what I can do in the next 15 min.
I went to the Holy Innocents Canteen last nite. It is really quite the place for a Catholic Church. They serve beer and my what a time. Boy you could of knocked me down with a feather[.] There was a Chaplain there [-] a Major at that [-] and he is also the Pastor of the Church which is right above the <so>beer</so> social hall. Of course nobody gets under the influence of the stuff but boy do you have a fine time.
I spent all day today in the Barracks [-] can you beat that. The whole bks is surprised when "Liberty Hound Riordan" stays in. I've been busy all day through[.] I had a *%^$@ watch today from noon till 4 and that's a boring job.
Got a letter from Mac Saturday and he's still at Great Lakes. I've got to answer him yet tonite. So I'd better close for now more tommorrow [sic].

Dear Folks,
Well here I am again and this time I don't have much to say. The usual stuff. I didn't have a big time last week like I usually have. I had a watch on Sunday so that fouled me up. Enclosed you will find some of the tickets I didn't use. You know I'm a busy man & can't make all the affairs they want me to. I'm popular around here and am I having fun.
Don't worry I'll send Mary Jane a Birth card tomorrow if I can remember. You know I'm a busy man, all my classes and then liberty [-] boy does it keep me busy. Right now I'm having a tough time writing this. There is a big bull session and it's pretty fast and furious.
I'm having a tough time trying to think of something to write. Oh here is something[:] I went over to Brooklyn Naval Hospital Saturday and seen [sic] my two buddies. That's a pretty big hospital[.] They have ever[y] kind of cast in that place.

Dear Folks,
Well I'm back again. I havent heard from you in a couple of days. I'm really disappointed in my mail. I wrote about 6 letters in the last 2 days and I havent good [sic] a letter since Friday. Isn't that awful.
Yesterday (Saturday) I didn't do a thing. I'm broke. You know there had to be some good reason. But today I went to the Newman Federation meeting. Boy was that great. Mgr. Sheen is the best speaker I ever heard. In fact all the Speakers were good. You will find enclosed all the slips they gave me at the Breakfast. But the mass at St. Patrick's was really great. That church was the biggest one I was ever in. It makes P.B. [Precious Blood] look like a telephone booth. I sure wish you were there. You would have really enjoyed it.
I went to the Stevens Theater Friday. That's the school play. It was pretty good but even Catholic Central has much better plays than they have here. You really don't appreciate C.C.H plays until you see some of these lousy Broadway plays. I havent done very much homework in the past 6 weeks but I do my English because I know I'll have to take it at U of D. About the getting out in September. I got the word from a Captain in the Navy and he said all USNR would be out in Sept. 
Pretty good eh!

[No return address, but from the text of the letter, it seems to be from Camp Shoemaker, California.]
Dear Folks,
Today is Sunday but it is just another day around here. I even missed mass but it wasn't my fault. We had to fall out at 0645. We even missed our chow this morning. I was better [?] hungry when noon came around. We are being processed today. By that I mean we got our overseas shots and dental check. At 2 o'clock we are going to be classified [?]. They give us a chance to choose our ship. It probably won't mean much but you never can tell. I'm going to ask for a APA. That's a transport. They make what they call Magic Carpet runs. That is they make quick trips back & forth. You get good liberty and there aren't many regulations. Not that I'm trying to get some thing easy because that is all that reserves can get. I might as well have the satisfaction of getting what I ask for.
I met Bob Williams yesterday. It seems like I'm following the guy. I spent all morning looking for the guy and when I found his barracks he wasn't in but I met a guy that use [sic] to Jerry servant [?] ha. Jerry left a note for me with him. Jerry shipped out Friday at noon. He's on a APA[.] It's the USS Logan. I don't know where he's going[;] you never can tell. Well to get back to Bob Williams I left him a note and told him where I was so he looked me up and I wasn't in so he left me a note. Kind of a round about way isn't it. Well I finally got hold of him at 3:30 so we spent the rest of the day together. 
This is the best base I've been on yet. The climate is really nice but it is a little cool today. It was pretty warm yesterday but it gets cold at nite. Really nice for sleeping. I guess I'll go to the show with Bob Williams to-nite. They have 3 nice shows, 3 bowling alleys[,] a couple pool parlors, a skating rink and a couple swimming pools. Not bad eh?
This is small compared to G. L. and it's cleaner at G. L. but you can't beat it for scenery [?] around here. Shoemaker is entirely surrounded by mountains. I could tell you more but I've got to be back soon. By that I mean I'm going to classified and I can't miss that. I'll enclose a map so you can see where I've been!

Dear Folks,
I've finally worked up enough ambition to write and tell you how I am. Well I'm not so good. I'm getting more embittered at this Navy every day. The trouble is you never know what's coming next. I guess I've said that before but they aren't sure when they are going to let us off this barge. About a week ago they said right after this trip but now it's some time in August. I'll probably be by Christmas anyway.
I forgot to mention, so far, that we pull into Pearl Harbor again tomorrow. I”ll get to know that place better than New York[.] It's a dump but I like the weather[.] I don't think we'll be there long enough to talk about so I'll end that part of the letter.
I write so few letters now that I can hardly write[.] you can plainly see that I know whereof I speak.
We have 2200 boots [?] on board[.] Some of them look like Rich. Boy it really is a shame to see some of these “kids” who have 2 [?] years ahead of them. They maybe just a year or less younger than me but some of them certainly don't look it.
Well I have the mid-watch again tonite. It really is a tough one from midnite till 4 just standing there in the dark getting sleepy. I wouldn't mind it if I was doing some thing.
I'm going to enclose a picture of a ship that is just like ours so you know what this barge looks like. On one of the pictures you will notice that I've put some arrows. That is my end of the ship.
I'll write more before we leave Pearl Harbor

Dear Ma, Dad & Kids,
I'm going to try & make this interesting if I can but if I don't please bear with me. I'm so out of the habit of writing it's miserable.
Tomorrow we get back to the States again. This time for the last time I hope. I can't be sure but I think I'll be discharged one month from now. I'll be glad to see that day.
I really don't hate the navy[;] it just seems like a waste of time[.] You never seem to accomplish anything yet you work 10 or 12 hrs a day. The watches are what get me. Those extra 8 hrs a day really don't leave you much to do anything. The only reason I have time now is because today is Sunday. The other [sic] I went to the show with Manley [?]. It was the first one in a month and what has to happen. Around 830 they saw 4 flares so we changed course and cruised [??] around all nite playing our search lights around. We never did find anything.
I'm in the boat crew so if we did spot anything I would have been over the side. I didn't get back to the sack till 9:30 the next morning. I know I'm going to spend a lot of time in the sack.
We really have an assortment of passengers this trip. We have 100 civilians[,] 500 army[,] 300 mariens [sic] & 300 navy. And then we have 70 women. They sure are a lot of trouble. They've got the ship all caged off as to where you can go and where [sic] can't.
I'm going to send a box home one of these days. It will just have some odds & ends in it but don't throw anything away [-] it may come in handy one of these days.
I've got about $20 worth of underwear & socks so I don't think I'll ever have to worry about that again.
I haven't had any mail in two weeks so I don't know what the story is. Has Joe Peters been discharged? Any news of Mac?
I'll proably [sic] get a pile of mail tomorrow. I would like to keep up with the news as I plan to get into full swing when I get home again. I'm still wondering what to do. Is there any news from U of D?
The weather here isn't any to [sic] good[;] it looks like it's going to rain most of the time. It's winder & cold. I wear a heavy jacket most of the time. I sure will be glad to get back to some civilized weather.
Must call it a day now and head for the sack.
Loving Son,
Jack

Dear Folks,
At last I have found some time to write. The only for [?] it is that I missed my boat back to the ship so I have to wait an hour for the next one.
I got back into port the 15th. Our ship had just pulled in when who do I see waiting on the dock but Mac. Was I surprised. He had just pulled in a half an hour before on another transport so I didn't know he was on it. The decommissioned his ship in China and shipped him home. He is probably on his way to Great Lakes now. The lucky dog.
He was sent over to T. I. (Treasure Island) and then given a 48 hr pass. What a deal. It only takes about 10 days to get discharged so he may be home in a week. He is going to pave the way for me. So he said.
I don't know what my chances are now. We arent going to make any more trips so it won't be too bad. What's more we are pulling into dock next week which will make it much easier.
I got your letter with the card from U of D enclosed[.] I'm glad they know I'm still around.
I'll write tomorrow for my transcript of credits. I don't want an advanced standing but I guess they'd like to know how I made out at Stevens.
Detroit seems to be having a rough time of it with all these tornados. I lived there 18 yrs and never see [sic] then I go away for a couple of months and what happens[:] we have two of them.
I hope you are on the prowl for some white shirts for me. Are they still hard to get? Maybe I'll pick some up out here.

P. S. (To last nite's letter)
I recieved [sic] your letter last nite when I came in. It got here in record time[:] 2 days. In the same mail I got a letter from Jerry Brazzil. I guess I'll go over and see if I can find him again. I spent two nites looking for him last time we were in and never found him.
I throught [sic] I'd tell you not to take much stock in what I say. After all things aren't as bad as I make out in some of my letters. I've been taking it pretty easy. We are waiting for some new men to come aboard so they can do the work. I have boat duty and that [is] the only thing that makes it tough. I still get enough sleep. More than I ever got a [sic] home. Boat duty is easy work[,] but it has bad hours[.] still I get to sleep in till 11 o'clock the next morning. 
Jerry said Rosemary was engaged[.] That was news to me. I guess I should send her something.
Sorry I haven't written much but I keep figuring I'll beat it home so I don't write. But seriously I can assure with a maximum amount of certainty that I will be home for your anniversary.
Tell Jim that I have [?] him a game of baseball. I havent touched one in a long time but I can still beat him. (Maybe)
Uncle Art & Aunt Kate are sure lucky[.] I would like to have a boat. Ask them if the need a coxswain. I know I could run it. I run a 36 ft LCOP now and that isn't tough. Bill Brazzil ought to be able to make it stand up on end. He's an old timer at the game.
Must close now

P. P. S. 15 minutes after I had written this they told us to get ready for sea[.] They say we may leave tomorrow for God knows where. Unless they do something quick I may not be home for Sept.

Dear Folks,
I thought I'd drop you a line and tell you I am no longer on the Renville. I'm stationed on T. I. (Treasure Island to you)[.] I got off the ship Monday. They had to let us off because the ship is going to China and it won't get back till late September and I'm suppose [sic] to be out by then.
This will probably be my last letter home for a long time. I don't want you to write any more because I won't get your letters. I'm going to do some traveling so I doubt if they'll get to me.
This damn pen is giving me a rough time as you can see. Manley [?] suggested we write home and tell them what we did with our money. He wired home the same time I did. We have been on liberty since Monday and I must say we are enjoying ourselves. The Shriners are having there [sic] annual convention so the town is really jumping.
I'm waiting to meet Bob Williams right now. I went over to see him this moring [sic] so I told him to meet him [sic] as soon as he got liberty. 
I sent a box home last Friday so it must be there by now. There is a lot of stuff there I'll never use but dont throw any of it away. I sent my sea bag home 2 days ago so it will be there some time within the next two weeks so just hang on.
Say if you have recovered from your vacation see if you can get some of my civilian clothes cleaned up. Suits[,] shirts[,] ect. [sic] You never can tell when I may drop in.
I was wondering if you ever got me any white shirts[.] you know I'm going to be a big boy when I get home and I'll want to dress up when I go out. Say is my blue suit still in good shape. If it is have it cleaned for me will you.
Must close now
See you soon (Aug 10)
Loving Son

P. S. Saw Dan [?] Burke the other day.

2022-12-04  Now that I've transcribed the letters, I'm thinking about how to make a website of them.
I'd like to use Adobe Source Serif 4 on the website, as I have done here.
I created a project, JacksLetters, on https://fonts.adobe.com/my_fonts#web_projects-section
To use these fonts on a web page, copy this code into the <head> tag of your HTML.
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.typekit.net/knj3pnz.css">
Here's the font info:
font-family: source-serif-4,serif;
font-weight: 400;
font-style: normal;
