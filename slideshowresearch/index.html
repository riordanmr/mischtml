<h1>Slide Show Research</h1>

<p>Here's the result of my research on free tools to create slideshow 
    videos from photos, with music in the background.
    There are a lot more ways to do this; these are just the ones I found
    before deciding to bring my research to a close.
    It so happened that all the tools I reviewed were web-based.
</p>
<p>
    The tools are rated roughly in decreasing order of preference, based on
    my perception of what the average user would prefer.
</p>
<p>
    For each tool, I created a sample slideshow from the same set of photos.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.media.io/slideshow-maker.html">Media.io</a> (by WonderShare)</h2>
<p>Media.io offers many photo and video tools; the photos-to-slideshow tool
    seems to be one of their more obscure ones.
    I put this tool at the top of the list mostly because it's the easiest to use.
</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Easy to use</li>
    <li>Free version seems to have no limitions like watermarking of output, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Extremely basic; very few options.  For instance, there's no way
        to add text to your slides, or to tweak your photos after uploading.</li>
    <li>There doesn't seem to be a way to save projects from one session
        to the next, even though the website implies otherwise.
    </li>
    <li>The website is poorly laid out. I stumbled upon the slideshow maker at
        <a href="https://www.media.io/slideshow-maker.html">https://www.media.io/slideshow-maker.html</a>
         and had to make a bookmark
        because it's difficult to find on the website.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="https://www.adobe.com/express/create/video/slideshow">Adobe Express</a></h2>
<p>Adobe Express is the free version of many of Adobe's tools. 
    Adobe is known for its expensive, hard-to-learn, professional-grade applications, 
    and Adobe Express reflects that heritage, even though it's free and somewhat dumbed-down.
</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Quite powerful, especially for a free tool. </li>
    <li>Free version seems to have few limitions like watermarking of output, 
       etc.</li>
    <li>Unlike many of its competitors, Adobe is a well-established company that is 
        likely to be around for a long time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>There's a significant learning curve.</li>
    <li>You have to do a lot of work to get a slideshow that looks
        halfway decent.  The tool is more interested in allowing you to
        create exactly what you want than in making it easy to create anything.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="https://animoto.com">Animoto</a></h2>
<p>Animoto is a website that is largely oriented towards making slideshows.
    It would be my top recommendation if it weren't for the fact that 
    it watermarks the output of its free version.
</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fairly powerful; approaches Adobe Express in that regard. </li>
    <li>Easy to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Free version leaves a watermark that is present on the entire video.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="https://www.kapwing.com/studio/editor">Kapwing</a></h2>
<p>Kapwing is a fairly powerful video editing website that approaches Adobe Express
    in slideshow-relevant capabilities, while being perhaps a bit easier to use.
</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fairly powerful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>They really, really want you to get a paid account.
        In fact, you can't get a free account at all, though you can use
        the website without an account. I'm not sure how it tracks your
        projects from one session to the next.
    </li>
    <li>Free version does not allow export of videos, so the only way
        you could share them is to send or post a link to your project
        on the kapwing.com website.</li>
</ul>
