I help my Inner Child build her self-esteem in a variety of ways. I affirm her identity every day by telling her, eye-ball to eye-ball in a mirror, "You are loved. You are lovable." 
I encourage, affirm, and reinforce her when she tries to learn or do something new. I show her how to do things before I ask her to do them by herself, or I take her to a class or hire an instructor to teach us if we don't know how to do something we want or need to do. 
I help her make a plan to get to a goal, create incremental objectives that lead to the goal, and then help her take the baby steps by cheering her on as she takes those steps. 
I reward her for trying and finishing. 
If she does not complete the goal, I tell her she did a great job of trying, and now we need to decide if we want to make a better plan with even smaller steps or if we want to do something different. 
My Inner Child and I have an agreement that if someone crosses our boundary-lines, she gives me a tiny tap from inside to alert me to incoming salvos. 
It is then my adult job to respectfully confront the abuser and resolve the situation amicably if possible. If not, then it is my adult job to decide what to do about this situation that is both moral and legal. 
That may mean deciding if the fight is worth fighting at all. If not, we walk away with the full understanding there are some things that just are not worth dying for, that there is a time to stand and a time to walk away. 
My Inner Child today feels safe enough to speak freely to me. We have a good relationship now that I honor her and she honors me. We have mutual respect or one another, for our strengths. 
We have forgiveness in our hearts for our weaknesses. We are both working to keep the relationship growing.
