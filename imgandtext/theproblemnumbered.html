        <h1>The Problem</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Many of us found that we had several characteristics in common as a result of being brought up in an alcoholic or dysfunctional household.</li>
            <li>We had come to feel isolated and uneasy with other people, especially authority figures.</li>
            <li>To protect ourselves, we became people-pleasers, even though we lost our own identities in the process.</li>
            <li>All the same we would mistake any personal criticism as a threat.</li>
            <li>We either became alcoholics (or practiced other addictive behavior) ourselves, or married them, or both.</li>
            <li>Failing that, we found other compulsive personalities, such as a workaholic, to fulfill our sick need for abandonment.</li>
            <li>We lived life from the standpoint of victims.</li>
            <li>Having an overdeveloped sense of responsibility, we preferred to be concerned with others rather than ourselves.</li>
            <li>We got guilt feelings when we stood up for ourselves rather than giving in to others.</li>
            <li>Thus, we became reactors, rather than actors, letting others take the initiative.</li>
            <li>We were dependent personalities, terrified of abandonment, willing to do almost anything to hold on to a relationship in order not to be abandoned emotionally.</li>
            <li>Yet we kept choosing insecure relationships because they matched our childhood relationship with alcoholic or dysfunctional parents.</li>
            <li>These symptoms of the family disease of alcoholism or other dysfunction made us "co-victims", those who take on the characteristics of the disease without necessarily ever taking a drink.</li>
            <li>We learned to keep our feelings down as children and kept them buried as adults.</li>
            <li>As a result of this conditioning, we confused love with pity, tending to love those we could rescue.</li>
            <li>Even more self-defeating, we became addicted to excitement in all our affairs, preferring constant upset to workable relationships.</li>
            <li>This is a description, not an indictment.</li>
        </ol>
