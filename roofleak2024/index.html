<span>This is above the larger sliding glass doors in the downstairs guest room. The wet ceiling appears across all 4 consecutive glass doors.</span>

<span>A representative from Central Glass looked at this and said that it was not due to a leak in the sliding glass doors (indeed, it's <i>above</i> the doors), nor to a leak in the windows in the bedroom above this room.</span>

<span>This is on the wall in the bedroom above the guest room. The window guy said it was not due to a window leak; the windows are fine.  He said that 90% of leaks like this are a roof problem. This could well be due to the same leak as above.</span>

<span>This is a leak in the corner of the upstairs living room. This leak had appeared before and I had believed that Hale's had fixed it, but it's back.</span>
