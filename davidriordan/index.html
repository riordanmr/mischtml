        <h1>Music from a Riordan</h1>
        <p>I was going through my collection of vinyl records, in preparation 
           for rehoming them, when I came across a song by a musician named
           David Riordan. The song is titled "Hold Me", and was originally from 
           album "Medicine Wheel" (1974).
           The album I got it from is Warehouse Sound Co. &amp; Friends, Vol III.
           (Remember sampler albums?)
        </p>
        <p>You should be able to play the song by clicking on the filename below.
