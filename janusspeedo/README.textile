h1. Project Janus Speedometer

This is a clone of the "Canvas Speedometer" project (see below) which displays a fake
speedometer for MOVEit Automation "Project Janus".  It was created by Mark Riordan in Nov 2021
for a humorous video.   

What follows is text from the original project:

This is a simple speedometer widget implemented using the standard HTML5 Canvas APIs.

It has been tested on Webkit (Safari/Chrome), Gecko (Firefox/Iceweasel/...) and IE starting from version 9.
