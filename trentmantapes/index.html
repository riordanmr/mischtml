        <h1>1960s Trentman / Riordan Recordings</h1>
        <p>Below are links to recordings made by the Jack and Mary Riordan family
            and the Don and Eileen Trentman family, on reel-to-reel tape recorders
            in the 1960s.
            They sent tapes back and forth between the US and Japan, 
            as this was less expensive than international long-distance phone calls
            at the time.
        </p>
        <p>
            The recordings can be difficult to follow. 
            Although the technical quality is mostly good, tapes were often
            partly overwritten, with confusing results.
            A given tape might start with one group of
            people, jump to another time with another group of people, then revert
            back to the first group - often with some inexplicable musical interludes.
        </p>
        <p>These recordings were transcribed to compact disc by a friend
            perhaps around 2010, then later ripped to MP3.
